#### Project Overview: Sentiment Analysis System

This project focused on developing a sentiment analysis system to classify the polarity of text as positive, negative, or neutral. The assignment provided a practical opportunity to apply text classification techniques and sentiment analysis, aligning with key Course Learning Outcomes.

#### Objectives

1. **Apply NLP Concepts and Algorithms**:
   - Utilized fundamental concepts and algorithms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address real-world text classification problems.
   
2. **Implement NLP Methods**:
   - Leveraged existing NLP tools to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text summarization.

3. **Decompose Real-world Problems**:
   - Analyzed real-world NLP problems and broke them down into manageable sub-problems to identify effective solutions.

#### Methodology

1. **Dataset and Code Template**:
   - Started with a provided dataset and a code template to streamline the development process.
   
2. **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Implemented both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify the sentiment polarity of the text.
   - Used algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Means clustering for classification and clustering tasks.

3. **Text Pre-processing**:
   - Conducted essential text pre-processing steps including tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization to prepare the data for analysis.

4. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracted relevant features from the text using methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Trained models on the pre-processed dataset and evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compared the results of different models to identify the most effective approach for sentiment analysis.

#### Results and Insights

The sentiment analysis system successfully classified the polarity of text with high accuracy. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for sentiment analysis. It also highlighted the importance of text pre-processing and feature extraction in NLP tasks.
